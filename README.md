# Matrix Solver
Matrix Solver is a web application that allows you to solve systems of linear equations using Gaussian elimination. You can input the matrix coefficients and the result values, and the application will show you the steps of the Gaussian elimination process and the final solutions.

## Getting started
To use the Matrix Solver, you can simply download the project files and open the index.html file in your web browser. Alternatively, you can visit the live version of the application here.

## Usage
To solve a system of linear equations using Matrix Solver, follow these steps:

1. Input the number of rows and columns in your matrix using the dropdown menus.
2. Input the matrix coefficients and result values in the input fields of the table and the results container, respectively.
3. Click the "Решить" button to see the steps of the Gaussian elimination process and the final solutions.
